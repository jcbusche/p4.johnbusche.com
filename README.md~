Project 4

	I am a dreadfully slow reader.  This is something I would very much like to change about myself, so my past two projects have focused on training people to read more quickly.  My project allows users to easily dump text into a form and have a javascript function display it in chunks at the speed of the user's choosing.  By pushing themself to read slightly faster than they are comfortable doing, they can increase their general reading speed.  A user may also save an article for later reading.  All in all users can:
	-Use the "Quick Read" function on the main page to challenge themselves on pieces of text they have in their clipboard.  This can be done WITHOUT creating an account.
	-If the user decides they like the basic functionality, they can create an account.
	-Once the account has been created, the user can save articles to read later.
	-In both reading views, the user can choose how many words they want to be displayed at once and how fast the words will change.
	-If the user mouses over the title of a saved article, they will be shown how many words are in the article and how long it will take them to read it with their current settings.
	-In the quick read view, if a user changes any of the form inputs, they will be show how long it will take to read what they currently have in the textarea with their current settings.
	-Users may also delete articles that they have saved.

The following items are managed by JavaScript:
	-Reading, both from text dumped into a textarea and from a saved artice
	-The display of article length and time to read in both reading views
